## Create WordPress Classic Theme

> Classic themes must  include the required theme files. These files must follow template file standards set by the themes team. For Classic themes, additional standard template files are recommended to use. Learn more about the [Organizing Theme Files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/organizing-theme-files/).

> Learn more about theme requirement using [Theme Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/releasing-your-theme/required-theme-files/) from **WordPress Developer** docs.

By default, **style.css**, **index.php** and **functions.php** are included in this project. They will be extracted to the project development (current) root directory.

To bootstrap theme development, run below command in terminal:

```sh
$ npm run create-wp-theme
```

To start development process after theme files are extracted, run below command in terminal:

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

Great going here!!! Now assets are minified on the fly and Coding Standards are monitored as you build your next best theme.

### ENJOY AND HAPPY CODING!!!
